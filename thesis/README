This is a directory containing a LaTeX template for the preparation of a Bachelor
or Master thesis at the "Institut fuer Astrophysik". The following files should
be included:

README
CHANGELOG.txt
GAUBM_astro.cls
aas_macros.sty
babelbst.tex
bthesis_astro.pdf
bthesis_astro.tex
bthesis_datenbank.bib
datenumber.sty
datenumberUSenglish.ldf
datenumberdummy.ldf
datenumberenglish.ldf
datenumberfrench.ldf
datenumbergerman.ldf
datenumberspanish.ldf
doktor_natb_bab_amp.bst

figures/IAG_LogoRGB.eps

figures/Logo_Physik_links.pdf
figures/Logo_Uni_Goett_1200dpi_cmyk.JPG
figures/Logo_Uni_Goettingen.eps
figures/Logo_Uni_Goettingen.pdf

For compiling bthesis_astro.tex, you can use an editor like "Kile" or do it
manually with the following command list (WARNING: you need to use EPS graphics
for the university and institute logos on the title page - change this in 
GAUBM_astro.cls, lines 182 to 191):

latex bthesis_astro
bibtex bthesis_astro
latex bthesis_astro
latex bthesis_astro

You may use "pdflatex" as well but can't include postscript images then. However,
you can convert eps or ps files into pdf format via "epstopdf".

If there are things that don't work or you have comments or ideas, please feel
free to contact
jlangfe@astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de

Of course, you may also use the original template maintained by Thomas Pruschke
and modify it yourself.
You can download it on the website of the Faculty for Physics:

THE ORIGINAL README:

This directory contains the class for the preparation of a Bachelor or
Master thesis according to the "Prueungsordnung fuer den Bachelor of
Science Physik und Master of Science Physik". You should have obtained the
following files:

README
GAUBM.cls
bthesis.pdf
bthesis.tex
bthesis_datenbank.bib
datenumber.sty
datenumberUSenglish.ldf
datenumberdummy.ldf
datenumberenglish.ldf
datenumberfrench.ldf
datenumbergerman.ldf
datenumberspanish.ldf
figures/bild.eps
figures/bild.pdf
figures/phi.eps
figures/phi.pdf
figures/unilogo_links.eps
figures/unilogo_links.pdf

To compile the file bthesis.tex, just give the following commands:

latex bthesis
bibtex bthesis
latex bthesis
latex bthesis

You now should have produced a valid DVI file you can look at with xdvi.
In case you encounter any trouble with missing packages, ask your administrator
to install these packages or download them and install them in the directory
these files reside in.

The file bthesis_datenbank.bib conains a small example for a BIBTeX database for
creating citations automatically. It is a good idea to create and maintain such a
database or add your citations to an exisiting database. Ask your supervisor for
help.

Take a careful look at the file bthesis.tex and the properly compiled result in the
supplied bthesis.pdf. It explains all necessary commands to cite, create formulae,
tables and figures from postscript. 

NOTE: If you intend to use PDFLaTex, you cannot include Postscript figures, but only
PDF. The tool epstopdf may be helpful here ...

Now have fun and good luck with your thesis! If you have any comments or suggestions
send them to 
pruschke@theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de
