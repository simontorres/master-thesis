\begin{abstract}
  One of the most important aspects of data analysis for astrophysics is the calibration. One technique of wavelength 
calibration for spectroscopy is using atomic standard, for instance, Molecular Iodine ($I_2$). A \emph{Gas Cell} is a 
container usually made out of glass/Pyrex in the shape of a cylinder with its interior filled with a gas. Molecular 
Iodine needs to be heated in order to be in gaseous state, from this temperature will depend the line depth (DELETE:: 
mainly and we'll see what else :: DELETE) therefore we worked on a way to have a very temperature stable Iodine$_2$ 
Cell. 
  We use a Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS) available at the Institute to perform 
  very high spectral resolution (R $\sim$ 600.000) measurements in order to characterize the \emph{spectral stability} in terms of line depth and wavelength
  solution.

\chapter{Introduction}
It's been a very long path since the beginning of spectroscopy, there has been 
a natural increase in the complexity of the technique.
This is only possible thanks to technological advances, in fact, science 
and technology depends on each other. Iodine cells have been in study
and use since more than a century, \cite{evans1910}. but only about two 
decades ago it has been used for \emph{precise radial velocity} measurements.

More than precise radial velocity measurements what is even more important is 
the \emph{long term stability}, specially important for the search of 
exoplanets, which at the end is precision as well but must not be confused.



\section{Motivation}
The reasons to study the influence of thermal stability on Iodine cells can be 
break down into two: First, it hasn't been done and second, the cell's 
temperature measuring methods are not very consistent therefore the gas' real 
temperature is less certain. In fact in our experiments we see that for an 
uncontrolled environment the temperature varies according to external factors 
such as: Air temperature, if the sun is hitting the window of the lab or if 
there is any source of heat in the surroundings.

From the scientific point of view the importance of this experiment is the 
benefit of knowing whether there is or not intrinsic variations in the 
wavelength solution of Iodine cells, such cells can be built with just one 
internal pressure (sealed glass tube, see Figure \ref{fig:gas-cell}) and then 
the observer controls the temperature by heating the walls of the glass and 
measuring in place. There are many drawbacks from this, for instance, the 
optical window can't be isolated therefore it is exposed to the environment. It 
will loose heat and it will always be at a lower temperature than the 
walls being heated, thus, most of the time the Iodine will condensate on the 
optical window creating black \emph{rocky} spots. This will be even more 
notorious for cells with large optical windows, say, around 5 cm or more.
%Soon after we started working it became obvious the importance of isolating 
%the experiment.

In general, besides the fact that there are many factors that will affect the 
reading, even more remarkable is the fact that the actual reading is made at 
the exterior of the cell and not inside, therefore the gas' temperature can be 
from less than one to several degrees, depending on the environment, 
cell's geometry and construction.

\section{Gas Cells}
Gas Cells are glass cylinder with optical windows on its extremes. The glass 
has to be of very low thermal expansion coefficient like \emph{borosilicate} 
(Pyrex). (because is going to be glued to the optical windows therefore it would 
create mechanical tension, optical properties, reduces the risk of breaking)

\subsection{Cell Heating}

Heating a gas cell can be very simple as it can be challenging. It is 
easy because it is basically expose it to a controlled source of heat and it can
be challenging when we think in terms of thermal stability and in the 
potential optical effects that may occur due to thermal gradients, for instance.
In the past (citation needed) the gas cells in use are heated up until the 
line depth satisfies the observer.

 \caption{In this diagram is depicted a very rudimentary \emph{heat flow} in a simple heated gas cell system. What is clear from this is that you need
 a stable environment in order to have some stability inside the cell. Why?, because you have most of all only loss of heat.}
 \label{fig:diag_heatloss}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

It is also important that the heat distribution is homogeneous, specially at low temperatures, since iodine will crystallize in the colder parts.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{A Simple Experiment}
One of the many small experiments I did while I was developing the larger one, provided me with some very clear insight on how temperature behaves in
gas cell plus heater system, and in my opinion has deep implications in the use of temperature controlled gas cells when gas temperature is critical.


\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/temperature_plot_2.png}
 % temperature_plot_2.png: 2400x1800 pixel, 300dpi, 20.32x15.24 cm, bb=0 0 576 432
 \caption{This experiment was made by hand, a couple of sensors placed in strategic points of an experimental cell. The dashed area corresponds to the time where power was on while
 the red vertical lines indicate the time when the outside and inside temperature reached their maximum. The dotted line is the maximum temperature inside. The dash-dotted line
 is 40 degree marker and the dashed line is the maximum obtained in the outside, which happens to be very close to the heating mechanism.}
 \label{fig:temp-plot}
\end{figure}


In the figure \ref{fig:temp-plot} you see that the interior and exterior temperatures vary in totally different ways.
Both differ in scale and timing and there is also a certain inertia, which is expected in this system. Mainly due to the insulation
that the glass provides.

In this first attempt I only wanted to see how the interior and surface temperature varied but a second extended experiment, using a very simple 
temperature control algorithm made me realize of something very important. See figure \ref{fig:simple-expe} and please take the time to identify what 
line is which. My conclusion is that this experiment, as simple as it is, demonstrates the fact that it is impossible to equalize both the exterior's and interior's
temperature if the environment is not controlled as well. This is very important because usually the cell's temperature is measured at the surface of the
cell but this value has nothing to do with the gas temperature. At this point we don't know yet how this impacts the wavelength solutions and if it does
this result is definitely very important. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/experiment-V_012.png}
 % experiment-V_012.png: 2400x1800 pixel, 300dpi, 20.32x15.24 cm, bb=0 0 576 432
 \caption{Simple experiment demonstrate that is impossible to equalize the external cell temperature with the internal, or the gas temperature. The larger
 the difference between target and the environmental temperatures, the larger is the lag of the internal temperature compared to that of the external surface.}
 \label{fig:simple-expe}
\end{figure}

Also, this highlights the importance of TheBox experiment since we will have the air surrounding the cell, i.e. the air inside the box, the same as the 
gas' target temperature therefore we can assume that at some point the gas inside the cell will equalize to the target temperature. We could go even further
from there: We could search for empirical temperature-to-line-depth relationship and test it with measurements in uncontrolled environments.

\subsubsection{The Algorithm}
The most common controllers are the so called the PID controller: 
\chapter{Experimental Design}
Since we don't know how large is the influence of the environment in the spectral output of an Iodine Cell, the goal was to develop an stable 
environmental chamber. [[I started proposing some some crazy ideas, although I knew they were absolutely feasible, their complexity would require
much more time than what is available for a Master Thesis.]] Some of them included cell containers in which the gas cell would have been inside a 
vacuum chamber but the problem with most of them was the need of additional optical windows that would have to sustain the pressure difference
and since this have to be done by transmissive optic elements, decrease the light transmission efficiency and possibly add optic distortions by the bending due to the already mentioned difference in pressure
from the inside with the outside. The final decision was to build a box isolating the inside with foam, placing the optical elements inside and 
attempting to control the temperature. Achieving stable temperature was top priority.
\section{Hardware}
In order to achieve our goals several and diverse pieces of hardware were required, since the beginning a general idea was established but 
some of them appeared later. Figure \ref{fig:diag_hardware} shows all the hardware components and how they interact with each other,
the optical part was ignored but is well explained later. The microcomputer known as \emph{Raspberry Pi} is the core of the temperature 
control and monitoring system. The local network is also an important part because after everything was working and stable, it allowed
to monitor and control the experiment remotely.
\subsection{Optical Setup}
The idea for the optical setup was taken from an existing one used in \emph{The G\"ottingen Solar Radial Velocity Project}  by \cite{lemke2016} 
Figure \ref{fig:optical_setup} shows the general idea and the optics involved. Although the displayed setup slightly differs from the final one,
all the important optical elements are present, also the relative positions of the elements is the same.

 \label{fig:optical_setup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{TheBox}
Although the optical lab was stabilized to about 21\textdegree C, there were variations
from day to night or from sunny to cloudy days, therefore it was very necessary to make use of an extra layer of isolation, but that was not the
only motivation, we really wanted to study a very temperature-stable gas cell and have control over its temperature. Figure \ref{fig:thebox-design-appended}
shows two versions of the initial design, the base for developing the design was the needed inner volume, or in other words: the volume needed by the optical 
setup (Figure \ref{fig:optical_setup}). After, things like available materials, construction technique and costs, safety and \emph{suitability for the job} 
were considered 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio=true]{./img/thebox_design_appended.png}
\caption{These are designs proposed to the workshop. (left) In orange you have the base and then there are screwable walls, all removable. In yellow, red, white and grey you have
the foam panels intended for thermal isolation. (right) One of the latest version of the design, but the principle is the same. At the end we allowed
the workshop decide the construction technique using this as a guide.}

\caption{In order to heat the air inside the box we ran a copper pipe inside, figure \ref{fig:thebox-interior}, the heat source is a 
\emph{Rework Station}, a tool used in electronics that throws  hot air through a nozzle, we let the hot air heat the pipe and the pipe heats the air inside.
We figure this is a less violent way to do it.}

see a copper pipe, this is used as a radiator to heat up the air inside, figure \ref{fig:thebox-hot-air-port} describes how it works. At the bottom-left
there is a fan, whose function is to homogenize the temperature within the internal volume of the box. Without it there are differences of about 1
degree from side to side and up to three from top to bottom, from TheBox's perspective.}

 \item Stability test over 12 hours at several temperatures such as: Ambient temperature approx 22, 30, 
40, 50, 60 FTS vacuum:
 \item Heating up from ambient temperature up to 60 degree
 \item Cooling down from 60 degree to ambient temperature
 \item Long term (10 hours) measure from lab temperature up to 60 degree (too see how long does it takes to stabilize 
line depth)
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Processing}
All the data was processed by Python scripts. It was developed in separated stages and then put together in a couple of different scripts. The next
list summarizes the key features kept in mind while developing them.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Spectral Range Cut
 \item Spline Interpolation
 \item Two Spectra Cross Correlation
 \item Line Detection
 \item Line Gaussian Fit
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Spectral Range Cut:} Selecting the spectral range is relatively easy. $wavenumber\\ cm^-1$ was the chosen unit because the data provided by
FTS data acquisition software comes natively with it. Therefore, in order to avoid error propagation from unit conversion all the process is done in wavenumber.


\textbf{Spline Interpolation} An interpolation is a mean to \emph{smooth} a data set by adding \emph{interpolated} points in between real data points.
This is helpful, for instance, in the case a signal is under sampled. Every interpolation uses a function to find the data points. 
A spline is a function (citation needed)... For this dataset a factor of twenty points was added. With the first attempt to perform a whole spectrum
spline interpolation I kept getting a MemoryError exception, because of the large amount of data being used. (add in the appendix code that worked?).

\textbf{Two Spectra Cross Correlation:} A cross correlation is used to compare two datasets in order to find similarities, in other words it could be
said that is a measure of similitude. It also possible to do self correlation in order to detect periodicity in a signal, for instance. In this case
we choose one spectrum and use it as template, usually the first of the series and then cross-correlate all the rest with respect to that one. 
There is no special reason to choose a particular one since we are interested in the relative variation and stability.

\textbf{Line Detection:} A very basic line detection algorithm is implemented, definitely improvable. The idea is to analyze very small portions of
the spectrum and measure its standard deviation. A second pass calculates the mean standard deviation of the whole spectrum and then detect 
spikes by comparing all the values to the previously calculated mean. A spike in standard deviation indicates a larger variation of the points, 
therefore the possible existence of a line. If a spike is detected a larger portion of the spectrum is covered and a minimum is obtained, 
this is used as a \emph{line candidate}. Two more conditions must be met. First is that the line candidate is at an absolute minimum and not, 
for instance, in the side of a line. An extra comparison is carried out in order to double check the previous condition. Finally, the line candidate must 
not been previously identified.

 \label{fig:line_detection}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:line_detection} shows a very small portion of the spectrum with its lines identified. Although not all the lines 
are identified it is not a problem for us since we have thousands of lines and right now we are only interested in the most 
prominent features.

\textbf{Line Gaussian Fit:}


\section{Results}

\chapter{Future Work}

One semester is too little time to do a master thesis properly. In fact I had four month and a half of effective time to work.
The experimental setup, also named \emph{TheBox}, is ready to work stable for very long periods. The experiments performed should be repeated 
in order to
