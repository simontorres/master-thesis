  Abstract                 = {Near-IR observations are important for the detection and characterization of exoplanets using the transit technique, either in surveys of large numbers of stars or for follow-up spectroscopic observations of individual planets. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we imaged \$\backslash sim 10\^{}4\$ critically sampled spots onto an Teledyne Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) detector to emulate an idealized star-field. We obtained time-series photometry of up to \$\backslash simeq 24\$ hr duration for ensembles of \$\backslash sim 10\^{}3\$ pseudo-stars. After rejecting correlated temporal noise caused by various disturbances, we measured a photometric performance of \$<\$50 ppm-hr\$\^{}\{-1/2\}\$ limited only by the incident photon rate. After several hours we achieve a photon-noise limited precision level of \$10\backslash sim20\$ ppm after averaging many independent measurements. We conclude that IR detectors such as the H2RG can make the precision measurements needed to detect the transits of terrestrial planets or detect faint atomic or molecular spectral features in the atmospheres of transiting extrasolar planets.},

  Abstract                 = {{We present the modeling technique we apply to analyse data of the ESO Coud\'{e} Echelle Spectrometer (CES) planet search program, in order to obtain high precision stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements. The detection of the Doppler reflex motion of a star due to an orbiting planet has so far been the most successful method to discover planetary companions to solar-type stars. The first extrasolar planet discovered by the CES program is the companion to the young (ZAMS) G0V star iota Hor (K\"{u}rster et al. $\backslash$cite\{martin00\}). To achieve a high long-term RV measurement stability the CES spectra are self-calibrated by a superimposed iodine vapor (I\_2) reference spectrum. In the modeling process a multi-parameter chi 2-optimization is employed to generate an accurate description of the observation. We largely follow the general modeling approach for I\_2-calibrated data outlined by Butler et al. ($\backslash$cite\{butler\}) and Valenti et al. ($\backslash$cite\{valenti\}). The sharp I\_2 reference lines allow the reconstruction of the spectrograph instrumental profile (IP) and the precise determination of the Doppler shift of the stellar absorption lines. We show examples of the application of the modeling technique to CES data obtained over a time span of five and a half years at ESO La Silla. The small spectral bandwidth of only 4.85 nm for CES spectra makes this data challenging for high precision radial velocities. We demonstrate for the known RV-constant star tau Cet, for two stars with known extrasolar planets, 51 Peg and 70 Vir, and for alpha Men and GJ 570A, two stars from our survey that the achievable RV precision for CES data is 8-15 ms-1.

  Abstract                 = {We present results of radial-velocity follow-up observations for the two Kepler evolved stars Kepler-91 (KOI-2133) and KOI-1894, which had been announced as candidates to host transiting giant planets, with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope and the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS). By global modeling of the high-precision radial-velocity data taken with Subaru/HDS and photometric data taken by the Kepler mission accounting for orbital brightness modulations (ellipsoidal variations, reflected/emitted light, etc.) of the host stars, we independently confirmed that Kepler-91 hosts a transiting planet with a mass of 0.66 \{\{M\}Jup\}(Kepler-91b), and newly detected an offset of ˜20 m s-1 between the radial velocities taken at ˜1 yr interval, suggesting the existence of an additional companion in the system. As for KOI-1894, we detected possible phased variations in the radial velocities and light curves with 2-3$\sigma$ confidence level, which could be explained as a reflex motion and ellipsoidal variation of the star caused by a transiting sub-Saturn-mass (˜0.18 \{\{M\}Jup\}) planet.},
